# Golang practice rp

Like all my practice projects I setup goals that I try to reach.

## Goals
* Create a simple SSH client
* Take an array of ip addresses
* Use goroutines to parallelize ssh commands
* Send results to channel that returns an array
* Sequential SSH commands should stop on IPs that had previous failures but continue on successful ones
* Output results of every SSH command to console. 
* Use .ssh directory for default private keys but allow option to specify
* Have functional tests
