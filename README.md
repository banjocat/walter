# Golang practice project

Like all my practice projects I setup goals that I try to reach.

## Goals
* It should actually work
* Create a simple SSH client
* ~~Take an array of ip addresses~~
* ~~Use goroutines to parallelize ssh commands~~
* ~~Send results to channel that returns an array~~
* Sequential SSH commands should stop on IPs that had previous failures but continue on successful ones
* ~~Output results of every SSH command to console.~~
* Use .ssh directory for default private keys but allow option to specify
* ~~Have functional tests~~
* Create automating testing on push
